Crystallographic structures of TCR-peptide/MHC complexes have demonstrated how TCRs simultaneously interact with both the peptide and the MHC protein. However, it is increasingly recognized that, beyond serving as a static platform for peptide presentation, the physical properties of class I MHC proteins are tuned by different peptides in ways that are not always structurally visible. These include MHC protein motions, or dynamics, which are believed to influence interactions with a variety of MHC-binding proteins, including not only TCRs, but other activating and inhibitory receptors as well as components of the peptide loading machinery. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which peptides tune the dynamics of the common class I MHC protein HLA-A2. By examining more than 50 lengthy molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-A2 presenting different peptides, we identified regions susceptible to dynamic tuning, including regions in the peptide binding domain as well as the distal a3 domain. Further analyses of the simulations illuminated mechanisms by which the influences of different peptides are communicated throughout the protein, and involve regions of the peptide binding groove, the B2-microglobulin subunit, and the a3 domain. Overall, our results demonstrate that the class I MHC protein is a highly tunable peptide sensor whose physical properties vary considerably with bound peptide. Our data provides insight into the underlying principles and suggest a role for dynamically driven allostery in the immunological function of MHC proteins.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Dynamically Driven Allostery in MHC Proteins: Peptide-Dependent Tuning of Class I MHC Global Flexibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541894400,"objectID":"8f43461731dd97c4a651077967359c83","permalink":"/project/2018-11-11-colour-palette-tutorial/","publishdate":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-11-11-colour-palette-tutorial/","section":"project","summary":"A tutorial is to demonstrate one way to create a colour palette and corresponding gradients in R","tags":["R"],"title":"Creating and using a colour palette and colour gradients for plotting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539388800,"objectID":"8c506ddb21e4abc508721455a75fe8e2","permalink":"/project/2018-10-13-umea-swc-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-10-13-umea-swc-workshop/","section":"project","summary":"Slides from  Software Carpentry Workshop, 9th and 10th October 2018 in Umeå Sweden","tags":null,"title":"Umeå Software Carpentry Workshop","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531699200,"objectID":"0f3865a1c8f9ce3a251915e2ba95f4b1","permalink":"/project/2018-07-16-bspr-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-07-16-bspr-workshop/","section":"project","summary":"Materials for proteomics data science workshop including introduction to R, Volcano plots, heatmaps and peptide logos","tags":["R","Proteomics"],"title":"British Society for Proteomics 2018 Data Science Workshop","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524182400,"objectID":"83d22dd1de2688cc21daae97b357c3a1","permalink":"/project/2018-06-17-mhc-ml/","publishdate":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-06-17-mhc-ml/","section":"project","summary":"A toy model that attempts to classify peptides from my some of my experiments according to one of five MHC class I allotypes present in the cells I use.","tags":["R","Deep Learning","MHC I antigen processing"],"title":"Machine Learning for MHC I peptide classification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1484870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484870400,"objectID":"61aa0435dc86cb0bd63d3fb9e8a43648","permalink":"/project/2018-05-17-hdx-dashboard/","publishdate":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-05-17-hdx-dashboard/","section":"project","summary":"A dashboard to display the results of the MHC I HDX project","tags":["R","Proteomics","MHC I antigen processing"],"title":"MHC dynamics dashboard","type":"project"},{"authors":["A. van Hateren","M.

Peptides are selected from a large diversity present in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, only a limited number of peptides complement the polymorphic MHC specificity determining pockets in a way that leads to high-affinity peptide binding and efficient antigen presentation. MHC I molecules possess an intrinsic ability to discriminate between peptides, which varies in efficiency between allotypes, but the mechanism of selection is unknown. Elucidation of the selection mechanism is likely to benefit future immune-modulatory therapies. Evidence suggests peptide selection involves transient adoption of alternative, presumably higher energy conformations than native peptide–MHC complexes. However, the instability of peptide-receptive MHC molecules has hindered characterization of such conformational plasticity. To investigate the dynamic nature of MHC, we refolded MHC proteins with peptides that can be hydrolyzed by UV light and thus released. We compared the resultant peptide-receptive MHC molecules with non-hydrolyzed peptide-loaded MHC complexes by monitoring the exchange of hydrogen for deuterium in solution. We found differences in hydrogen–deuterium exchange between peptide-loaded and peptide-receptive molecules that were negated by the addition of peptide to peptide-receptive MHC molecules. Peptide hydrolysis caused significant increases in hydrogen–deuterium exchange in sub-regions of the peptide-binding domain and smaller increases elsewhere, including in the α3 domain and the non-covalently associated β2-microglobulin molecule, demonstrating long-range dynamic communication. Comparing two MHC allotypes revealed allotype-specific differences in hydrogen–deuterium exchange, consistent with the notion that MHC I plasticity underpins peptide selection.

Classical MHC class I molecules (MHC I hereafter) are co-dominantly expressed, polygenic, and exceptionally polymorphic and have significant sequence diversity. Thus, in most species, there are many different MHC I allotypes expressed, each with different peptide-binding specificity, which can have a dramatic effect on disease outcome. Although MHC allotypes vary in their primary sequence, they share common tertiary and quaternary structures. Here, we review the evidence that, despite this commonality, polymorphic amino acid differences between allotypes alter the ability of MHC I molecules to change shape (that is, their conformational plasticity). We discuss how the peptide loading co-factor tapasin might modify this plasticity to augment peptide loading. Lastly, we consider recent findings concerning the functions of the non-classical MHC I molecule HLA-E as well as the tapasin-related protein TAPBPR (transporter associated with antigen presentation binding protein-related), which has been shown to act as a second quality-control stage in MHC I antigen presentation.","tags":["class I antigen presentation; major histocompatibility complex; peptide loading; plasticity"],"title":"Recent advances in Major Histocompatibility Complex class I antigen presentation: Plastic MHC molecules and TAPBPR-mediated quality control.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461110400,"objectID":"fa0effd631b9e153e7091698f58eecd7","permalink":"/project/2016-04-20-heatmap-tutorial/","publishdate":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2016-04-20-heatmap-tutorial/","section":"project","summary":"A short tutorial for producing heatmaps in R using some sample data.","tags":["R"],"title":"R heatmap tutorial using d3heatmap","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This project sought to explain the mechanism of peptide selection by two functionally distinct MHC I allotypes using a combination of molecular dynamics and mathematical modelling of biochemical experiments.\nIn collaboration with the Biological Computation Group at Microsoft Research Cambridge we used biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection, and molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity.\nThis led to the proposal that MHC I cofactor tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and membrane bound domain.\nPublication A.

We developed computational systems models encoding distinct mechanistic hypotheses for two molecules, HLA-B*44:02 (B*4402) and HLA-B*44:05 (B*4405), which differ by a single residue yet lie at opposite ends of the spectrum in their intrinsic ability to select high affinity peptides. We used in vivo biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection. We used molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity, and confirmed this experimentally by altering the plasticity of MHC I with a single point mutation, which altered in vivo selector function in a predictable way. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms by which the co-factor tapasin influences MHC I plasticity.

The function of MHC I molecules is to select high affinity peptides from a large intracellular pool and they are assisted in this process by co-factor molecules, notably tapasin. In contrast to mammals, MHC homozygous chickens express a single MHC I gene locus, termed BF2, which is hypothesised to have co-evolved with the highly polymorphic tapasin within stable haplotypes. The BF2 molecules of the B15 and B19 haplotypes have recently been shown to differ in their interactions with tapasin and in their peptide selection properties. This study investigated whether these observations might be explained by differences in the protein plasticity that is encoded into the MHC I structure by primary sequence polymorphisms. Furthermore, we aimed to demonstrate the utility of a complimentary modelling approach to the understanding of complex experimental data. Combining mechanistic molecular dynamics simulations and the primary sequence based technique of statistical coupling analysis, we show how two of the eight polymorphisms between BF2*15∶01 and BF2*19∶01 facilitate differences in plasticity. We show that BF2*15∶01 is intrinsically more plastic than BF2*19∶01, exploring more conformations in the absence of peptide. We identify a protein sector of contiguous residues connecting the membrane bound α3 domain and the heavy chain peptide binding site. This sector contains two of the eight polymorphic residues. One is residue 22 in the peptide binding domain and the other 220 is in the α3 domain, a putative tapasin binding site. These observations are in correspondence with the experimentally observed functional differences of these molecules and suggest a mechanism for how modulation of MHC I plasticity by tapasin catalyses peptide selection allosterically.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Two Polymorphisms Facilitate Differences in Plasticity between Two Chicken Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A. van Hateren","R.

The co-factor tapasin functions to ensure that MHC I becomes loaded with high affinity peptides. In most mammals, the tapasin gene appears to have little sequence diversity and few alleles and is located distal to several classical MHC I loci, so tapasin appears to function in a universal way to assist MHC I peptide loading. In contrast, the chicken tapasin gene is tightly linked to the single dominantly expressed MHC I locus and is highly polymorphic and moderately diverse in sequence. Therefore, tapasin-assisted loading of MHC I in chickens may occur in a haplotype-specific way, via the co-evolution of chicken tapasin and MHC I. Here we demonstrate a mechanistic basis for this co-evolution, revealing differences in the ability of two chicken MHC I alleles to bind and release peptides in the presence or absence of tapasin, where, as in mammals, efficient self-loading is negatively correlated with tapasin-assisted loading. We found that a polymorphic residue in the MHC I α3 domain thought to bind tapasin influenced both tapasin function and intrinsic peptide binding properties. Differences were also evident between the MHC alleles in their interactions with tapasin. Last, we show that a mismatched combination of tapasin and MHC alleles exhibit significantly impaired MHC I maturation in vivo and that polymorphic MHC residues thought to contact tapasin influence maturation efficiency. Collectively, this supports the possibility that tapasin and BF2 proteins have co-evolved, resulting in allele-specific peptide loading in vivo.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A mechanistic basis for the co-evolution of chicken tapasin and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

(We had a break during the industrial action.)\nThe course was intended to be open to 20 learners from across the University, but\rafter opening application on a first come, first serve basis to those on the Life Sciences\rmailing list, the course was filled within an hour of advertisement by\rlearners almost exclusively from Biological Sciences and Medicine, including three\radditional learners to the original 20, making a total of 23 learners registered.\nThe aim of the workshops was to provide a question driven introduction to working\rwith tabular data in R by introducing:\n\rthe R language in the RStudio interactive development environment.\rhow to organise analysis into a workflow.\rhow to import and export data and how the atomic data types are represented in R.\rdata transformation using R.\rvisualising data using R.\r\rThe course materials exist as an online book\rand some accompying slides.\nAs measured by the number of workshop survey respondents,\rthe workshops began with 23 learners and finished with 8 learners. A 65% attrition rate,\rworse than my prediction of 50%.\nDespite my best intentions, and as a result of my fairly poor attempts to recruit others, the workshops were led exclusively by me in contradiction of the\r“never teach alone” rule. It’s speculation, but this may\rin part account for the higher than expected attrition rate, as additional teachers\rand teaching assistants would, in my opinion, have improved the learning experience.\rHaving a number of teachers is certainly one of the best things about a Carpentries workshop\rin terms of creating a fun atmosphere and feeding back to each other within the workshop about\rwhat is working and not working so well.\nPrior to the workshops I also asked the learners to complete a survey designed\rto indicate their needs in order to help me align the lessons accordingly. The results\rare below in the data skills survey section.\nThe primary motivation for these workshops is from my own experience as someone\rwho in 2015 didn’t regard myself as someone who coded, but realised that I needed to learn to\rbetter data analysis skills in order to successfully do my research, and in a more efficient\rand reproducible way. Through an introduction to the R\rcommunity via Simply Statistics,\rI discovered that coding, and its associated skills and community met that unmet need. I subsequently observed that there\rare other people in my immediate environment in similar positions to myself,\rstruggling with their data too, but unsure of how\rto get started, and learning in largely ad-hoc ways.(This also reflected in the answers\rto data skills survey below.) This observation led me to join the Carpentries community and my involvement\rwith the Research Software Group in Southampton.\rIn the last decade there has been an explosion of free availability of materials\rfor teaching coding and data analysis in R and Python: The Carpentries, R for Data Science,\rTidy Tuesdays, and Teaching Tech Together to name a few.\rHence the materials I’ve put together largely draw from these existing materials,\rand there exist far more materials than can be covered in nine two hour sessions.\nThe hypothesis I’ve formulated is that there exists a large cohort of people - not just\rresearchers and students, but also administrators and others - within\rthe University of Southampton who don’t identify as coders, but who actually do\rcode informally through their use of Excel, Graphpad, Google, and other software, who would\rbenefit from some foundational coding skills if given the opportunity to learn, and\rthat these skills were taught from the stance of “What do you need?” and “Let’s work this out together.”\rrather than “You should learn this.” or “People who use Excel are idiots.”\rMoreover that anyone who would like to learn these foundational skills should be\rdo so within the University. Thirdly, that whilst this requires support from the top\r- those with the money and power - the form of the solutions should be community driven.\rA big reason why Coding togetheR is sub-optimal is that it has largely been driven by\rme, with all the errors and biases that I bring as an individual, when many eyes would optimise.\rI’m not sure what Universities think they are for any more,\rbut I’d like to think there is still room for just helping each other and doing things\rbecause they are intrinsically worthwhile, rather for than money, metrics or prestige.\rI’ve not been able to test my hypothesis yet, let alone\rdemonstrate anything concrete that would convince those with power and money to invest in these ideas,\rbut this was very much starting where I am, with what we have and who is around me,\rin order to take the first step in understanding what we should be doing. I would\rstill very much like to do a proper face-to-face data skills survey of a representative sample of\rpeople across the University to assess what needs people actually have and establish\ra bit of ground truth upon which to build an evidence base of what’s needed and what works to meet those needs.\nThe motivation for creating a series of workshops was in part from the feedback received at the\rCarpentries workshops I’ve worked on which are usually one or two intensive days,\rand learners express a desire for something with a lower cognitive load, and that\rincorporates spaced repetition. Weekly workshops seem like a good way to address\rthat point. Secondly learners also feed back that they particularly like\rlive coding and style of teaching i.e. formative and summative assessments,\rand the chance to see mistakes and how to correct them in real time. (In the final\rworkshop the learners spotted the missing comma was in a function when their code\rwas working, but mine wasn’t!).\nGiven the attrition rate, comparison of the anonymous pre and post-workshops surveys (see survey results) carried\rout is not massively informative. But the data such as it is, does indicate that of\rthe eight learners completing the post workshop survey, only one said they now\rwould not be able to use R to import, export, transform and plot data from a spreadsheet.\nQualitative feedback was in line with that received at Carpentries workshops in that\rthe process of writing code with others, slowly, and use of stickies to indicate when learners\rare OK or not were the most useful aspects. As for improvements, there were several requests for homework so\rlearners could practice between sessions, as well as for a more interesting and\rwider range of data sets. Not much love for the Portal Rodent Survey, and I think I\ragree it is a rather dull data set. There was also a request for more sessions, and\rone of the main things I learnt myself was that the content appropriate for two hours\ris far less than I thought originally.\nIn seeing some of the learners back at their research since the workshops,\rI’ve observed difficulties in translating concepts covered in the\rworkshops to their own work e.g. Recognising when matching observations between\rdatasets requires using a join function.\rProblem recognition is ubiquitous problem in itself. My anecdotal experience of asking\rresearchers (including myself) at all levels from Undergraduate to Professor what the question is\rthey are trying to answer, is that they struggle to provide a concise response, and this\ris usually the start of an iterative process to whittle down from the general\rto the specific. I don’t know whether this process is something that has\ra more formal approach in the context of teaching coding - ironically I couldn’t figure out\rhow to Google it - or is just what people\rinformally refer to as “experience”. It could simply be that the summative\rassessments weren’t actually doing what they were supposed to do in terms of\rdemonstrating whether I had conveyed the concepts. I think this is\ranother example of why one shouldn’t teach alone, and that this sort of issue\rwould be more easily addressed within a group leading to better lesson design and\rdelivery.\nIf this isn’t to be the end of the line, I think the next steps require me to follow\rGreg Wilson’s advice about building relationships,\rparticularly with some social scientists and the rest of the Research Software Group.\nI should also note here that a broader survey was carried out by the Research Software Group\rat the University of Southampton in 2019. It was broader in the sense that it aimed\rto survey software development as well as use, across all levels of expertise, rather\rthan my focus on those who don’t think of themselves as software users/coders, and on tool use.\rIt presents a picture of a University full of free ranging software users and developers in need of\rbetter support, however it’s limited by the issue of capturing only those who responded to the email,\rand are comfortable with the language of computer science such as “script” or “clean some data”.\rI’d be interested to see a question about how people from different disciplines interpret the word “software” in another\rsurvey and how it compares with the authors own description. I was struck by the omission of Microsoft Office or Google or\rother well known brand names from the description of what software is. Given the ubiquity of\rMS Office in generating research results, and search engines as a tool, I wonder what an A-B version of survey\rwith a more technical versus less technical description would have done to the survey answers? Possibly nothing!\rBut I guess that’s one motivation for engaging social scientists in this challenge.\rThe full report can be found here.\n\rCoding togetheR surveys results\rThe learners were asked these five questions before and after the workshop series:\nCould you import data from a spreadsheet and create a new variable (column) as a function of the existing variables?
