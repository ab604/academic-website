Crystallographic structures of TCR-peptide/MHC complexes have demonstrated how TCRs simultaneously interact with both the peptide and the MHC protein. However, it is increasingly recognized that, beyond serving as a static platform for peptide presentation, the physical properties of class I MHC proteins are tuned by different peptides in ways that are not always structurally visible. These include MHC protein motions, or dynamics, which are believed to influence interactions with a variety of MHC-binding proteins, including not only TCRs, but other activating and inhibitory receptors as well as components of the peptide loading machinery. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which peptides tune the dynamics of the common class I MHC protein HLA-A2. By examining more than 50 lengthy molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-A2 presenting different peptides, we identified regions susceptible to dynamic tuning, including regions in the peptide binding domain as well as the distal a3 domain. Further analyses of the simulations illuminated mechanisms by which the influences of different peptides are communicated throughout the protein, and involve regions of the peptide binding groove, the B2-microglobulin subunit, and the a3 domain. Overall, our results demonstrate that the class I MHC protein is a highly tunable peptide sensor whose physical properties vary considerably with bound peptide. Our data provides insight into the underlying principles and suggest a role for dynamically driven allostery in the immunological function of MHC proteins.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Dynamically Driven Allostery in MHC Proteins: Peptide-Dependent Tuning of Class I MHC Global Flexibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541894400,"objectID":"8f43461731dd97c4a651077967359c83","permalink":"/project/2018-11-11-colour-palette-tutorial/","publishdate":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-11-11-colour-palette-tutorial/","section":"project","summary":"A tutorial is to demonstrate one way to create a colour palette and corresponding gradients in R","tags":["R"],"title":"Creating and using a colour palette and colour gradients for plotting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539388800,"objectID":"8c506ddb21e4abc508721455a75fe8e2","permalink":"/project/2018-10-13-umea-swc-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-10-13-umea-swc-workshop/","section":"project","summary":"Slides from  Software Carpentry Workshop, 9th and 10th October 2018 in Umeå Sweden","tags":null,"title":"Umeå Software Carpentry Workshop","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" This post was motivated in part by Maëlle Salmon\u0026rsquo;s post about blogging and secondly from discussion with Laura Graham about my long term mission is to convince the University of Southampton (here in the UK) of the need to provide some minimum data science training and support.\nThe aim is to try to define the problem(s) a bit better and also a bit of a cry for help. I appreciate that none of this may be novel, but I needed to get it written down and out of my head.\nSome preliminaries Firstly, a few vital statistics about me at the time of writing: 23 years since I started work in the TV industry, 10 years since finishing my Engineering degree and starting in immunology, 5 years since I finished my PhD, 3 years since I started working in proteomics, and 3 years since I started learning R through the John Hopkins. (I still haven\u0026rsquo;t completed the capstone.) And finally 1 year since I did Data Carpentry instructor training.\nLearning R and about the related data science issues through the community has completely changed the way I work.\nSecondly, I\u0026rsquo;ve currently got four related soapbox issues:\n establishing if there is an unmet need for data science training establishing best practices in delivering data science training making the case for the data science officer biological data science  The first and second issues are the subject of this post as they are so closely related.\nThe third issue follows the first two, but perhaps even trickier: this is my proposal that just as one should have experimental officers for the purpose of training and development of skills in the laboratory, who are permanent members of staff and not on fixed contracts and thus retaining knowledge within the institution, these should exist for data skills. It\u0026rsquo;s a subject worthy of a separate post. And to be honest even if I could gather the evidence to convince myself, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure in the current political and economic climate of metric chasing I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to convince those in charge of it\u0026rsquo;s merits.\nThe fourth issue also needs a separate post, but contains issues such as how to communicate between experimenters and informaticians, and how to deal with the fact that (in my experience) experiments evolve with each replicate whereas analysts would like to have all data sets generated in a standard way.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s where I\u0026rsquo;m coming from, but returning to the matter at hand I\u0026rsquo;ve identified a number of issues which I\u0026rsquo;d love to investigate and get input on, and I expect there are others I\u0026rsquo;ve not thought of. Ultimately, I want to approach this as a scientist. My working assumption is that there is an unmet need for more data science training and support, but I always consider it possible that I am mistaken, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to take an evidence based approach.\nIssues Identification Pretty much everyone has data and has to analyse data, whether they are an archaeologist, biologist, social scientist, art historian or an engineer. I personally consider writing a formula in an excel spreadsheet coding. Therefore I assume almost everyone in academia codes to one degree or another. But when I turn to my neighbours (biologists) and ask them if they code they say No. They don\u0026rsquo;t identify as coding.\nFurthermore, when I attend events such as those for the research software community organised by my excellent colleagues in the Software Sustainability Institute it appears to be predominantly engineers, physicists and computer scientists in attendance. Which also means it is predominantly men. The third area these events highlight is the difference between those who predominately code to analyse data, and those who are more concerned with other aspects of coding such as machine control or code efficiency.\nCoding for me has been a necessary side effect of becoming a better scientist, not an end itself, and I suspect, but don\u0026rsquo;t know that this would be true of lots of other people, regardless of seniority.\nWhich leads me to two questions:\n How do we reach those who work with data, but who don\u0026rsquo;t identify as coders? And how do we establish if there is an unmet need amongst these individuals?  To this end I created a draft Data Analysis Survey Google Form. The aim was to create a survey that could be completed in a couple of minutes and ideally carried out face-to-face. Emails just get deleted and face-to-face may yield a more representative sample of the University population.\nEven if this is a good idea, the challenge I currently face is actually carrying out the survey. I really need a group of like minded individuals to get it done. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested to know if anyone has done this before and how they did it. Or if there is a better way forward.\nInclusivity Inclusivity is bound up with identification, and although I\u0026rsquo;ve not addressed it in my draft survey, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if it is part of why some people don\u0026rsquo;t identify as coding. They don\u0026rsquo;t feel welcome. Following examples such the carpentries code of conduct this would need to be part of any data science training set-up.\nEvidence base If we can identify those who would benefit from training/support, the next question is how do we establish what works best?\nFor example:\n Do biologists need something different from social scientists? Do post-graduates need something different from post-docs? Can we demonstrate to principal investigators that learning data science skills is not a waste of time? Perhaps most importantly of all, can we demonstrate that it brings value to the University? (They have the money.)  I don\u0026rsquo;t have any answers at the moment, but as far as I\u0026rsquo;m aware no-one is gathering information about what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t work here in Southampton. If anyone has ideas on about how to assess the efficacy of data science training or knows of studies, please let me know.\nData science skills as academic infrastructure In the last 10 years I\u0026rsquo;ve sat in numerous meetings where statistical/ informatics training and support have been proposed across biology and medicine, and yet we still don\u0026rsquo;t have a bioinformatics core or any standardised University wide training. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why, but working assumption is that is in part because these proposals are ad-hoc and based upon anecdote.\nIn comparison, in Southampton we have a large super computer that is key to many researchers. My understanding is that it only exists because of two years work to establish a business case throughout the University for such an infrastructure project.\nTo me, this suggests that we should consider data science skills as part of our infrastructure and approach as an issue worthy of sufficient resources to investigate systematically. And if this case is made, invested in to a similar degree.\nTiming, delivery and cognitive load Another anecdotal observation frequently made by postgraduate students when they start is that they get hours of inductions and workshops before they\u0026rsquo;ve generated any data or even understand their project. This makes little sense both in terms of the cognitive load of such a data dump or in terms of telling someone something weeks, or possibly months in advance of it\u0026rsquo;s utility.\nAs with other issues, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear idea of how to address this, but we need to consider this problem when thinking about training. I subscribe to DataCamp as it provides the flexibility for me to learn when it\u0026rsquo;s convenient or when a specific problem arises. What it lacks however is the invaluable face-to-face discussion of a bespoke situation that occurs in workshops or with a colleague.\nMy feeling is that there needs to be a range of resources available: on-line materials, user groups and peer led workshops for example. And my favourite idea: The Data Science Officer. It\u0026rsquo;s another reason why we need an evidence base to work from.\nHow to get started? That\u0026rsquo;s my non-exhaustive list of challenges to getting data science training off the ground here in Southampton. And whilst it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exclude one thing to do another, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether we should be starting by trying to get a useR group going to gauge the demand, or focusing on the survey, or doing something else? Time is limited always, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is most effective. One of my other concerns is that doing things for free always lets the University off the hook when they should be investing in their people.\nAs Maëlle said in her blog, one reason to write is voice amplification and I\u0026rsquo;d consider this post a good start if I get the attention of some helpful people either inside the University or in the community at large.\n","date":1532649600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532649600,"objectID":"07dac7b5f3ae0f70c0390ff408e34eb3","permalink":"/post/unmet-data-science-training/","publishdate":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/unmet-data-science-training/","section":"post","summary":"This post was motivated in part by Maëlle Salmon\u0026rsquo;s post about blogging and secondly from discussion with Laura Graham about my long term mission is to convince the University of Southampton (here in the UK) of the need to provide some minimum data science training and support.\nThe aim is to try to define the problem(s) a bit better and also a bit of a cry for help.

Peptides are selected from a large diversity present in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, only a limited number of peptides complement the polymorphic MHC specificity determining pockets in a way that leads to high-affinity peptide binding and efficient antigen presentation. MHC I molecules possess an intrinsic ability to discriminate between peptides, which varies in efficiency between allotypes, but the mechanism of selection is unknown. Elucidation of the selection mechanism is likely to benefit future immune-modulatory therapies. Evidence suggests peptide selection involves transient adoption of alternative, presumably higher energy conformations than native peptide–MHC complexes. However, the instability of peptide-receptive MHC molecules has hindered characterization of such conformational plasticity. To investigate the dynamic nature of MHC, we refolded MHC proteins with peptides that can be hydrolyzed by UV light and thus released. We compared the resultant peptide-receptive MHC molecules with non-hydrolyzed peptide-loaded MHC complexes by monitoring the exchange of hydrogen for deuterium in solution. We found differences in hydrogen–deuterium exchange between peptide-loaded and peptide-receptive molecules that were negated by the addition of peptide to peptide-receptive MHC molecules. Peptide hydrolysis caused significant increases in hydrogen–deuterium exchange in sub-regions of the peptide-binding domain and smaller increases elsewhere, including in the α3 domain and the non-covalently associated β2-microglobulin molecule, demonstrating long-range dynamic communication. Comparing two MHC allotypes revealed allotype-specific differences in hydrogen–deuterium exchange, consistent with the notion that MHC I plasticity underpins peptide selection.

Recognition by these sentinels of the immune system can lead to the destruction of the presenting cell, thus protecting the host from pathogens and cancer. Classical MHC class I molecules (MHC I hereafter) are co-dominantly expressed, polygenic, and exceptionally polymorphic and have significant sequence diversity. Thus, in most species, there are many different MHC I allotypes expressed, each with different peptide-binding specificity, which can have a dramatic effect on disease outcome. Although MHC allotypes vary in their primary sequence, they share common tertiary and quaternary structures. Here, we review the evidence that, despite this commonality, polymorphic amino acid differences between allotypes alter the ability of MHC I molecules to change shape (that is, their conformational plasticity). We discuss how the peptide loading co-factor tapasin might modify this plasticity to augment peptide loading. Lastly, we consider recent findings concerning the functions of the non-classical MHC I molecule HLA-E as well as the tapasin-related protein TAPBPR (transporter associated with antigen presentation binding protein-related), which has been shown to act as a second quality-control stage in MHC I antigen presentation.","tags":["class I antigen presentation; major histocompatibility complex; peptide loading; plasticity"],"title":"Recent advances in Major Histocompatibility Complex class I antigen presentation: Plastic MHC molecules and TAPBPR-mediated quality control.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alistair Bailey"],"categories":[],"content":" Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

We developed computational systems models encoding distinct mechanistic hypotheses for two molecules, HLA-B*44:02 (B*4402) and HLA-B*44:05 (B*4405), which differ by a single residue yet lie at opposite ends of the spectrum in their intrinsic ability to select high affinity peptides. We used in vivo biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection. We used molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity, and confirmed this experimentally by altering the plasticity of MHC I with a single point mutation, which altered in vivo selector function in a predictable way. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms by which the co-factor tapasin influences MHC I plasticity.

The function of MHC I molecules is to select high affinity peptides from a large intracellular pool and they are assisted in this process by co-factor molecules, notably tapasin. In contrast to mammals, MHC homozygous chickens express a single MHC I gene locus, termed BF2, which is hypothesised to have co-evolved with the highly polymorphic tapasin within stable haplotypes. The BF2 molecules of the B15 and B19 haplotypes have recently been shown to differ in their interactions with tapasin and in their peptide selection properties. This study investigated whether these observations might be explained by differences in the protein plasticity that is encoded into the MHC I structure by primary sequence polymorphisms. Furthermore, we aimed to demonstrate the utility of a complimentary modelling approach to the understanding of complex experimental data. Combining mechanistic molecular dynamics simulations and the primary sequence based technique of statistical coupling analysis, we show how two of the eight polymorphisms between BF2*15∶01 and BF2*19∶01 facilitate differences in plasticity. We show that BF2*15∶01 is intrinsically more plastic than BF2*19∶01, exploring more conformations in the absence of peptide. We identify a protein sector of contiguous residues connecting the membrane bound α3 domain and the heavy chain peptide binding site. This sector contains two of the eight polymorphic residues. One is residue 22 in the peptide binding domain and the other 220 is in the α3 domain, a putative tapasin binding site. These observations are in correspondence with the experimentally observed functional differences of these molecules and suggest a mechanism for how modulation of MHC I plasticity by tapasin catalyses peptide selection allosterically.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Two Polymorphisms Facilitate Differences in Plasticity between Two Chicken Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A. van Hateren","R.

The co-factor tapasin functions to ensure that MHC I becomes loaded with high affinity peptides. In most mammals, the tapasin gene appears to have little sequence diversity and few alleles and is located distal to several classical MHC I loci, so tapasin appears to function in a universal way to assist MHC I peptide loading. In contrast, the chicken tapasin gene is tightly linked to the single dominantly expressed MHC I locus and is highly polymorphic and moderately diverse in sequence. Therefore, tapasin-assisted loading of MHC I in chickens may occur in a haplotype-specific way, via the co-evolution of chicken tapasin and MHC I. Here we demonstrate a mechanistic basis for this co-evolution, revealing differences in the ability of two chicken MHC I alleles to bind and release peptides in the presence or absence of tapasin, where, as in mammals, efficient self-loading is negatively correlated with tapasin-assisted loading. We found that a polymorphic residue in the MHC I α3 domain thought to bind tapasin influenced both tapasin function and intrinsic peptide binding properties. Differences were also evident between the MHC alleles in their interactions with tapasin. Last, we show that a mismatched combination of tapasin and MHC alleles exhibit significantly impaired MHC I maturation in vivo and that polymorphic MHC residues thought to contact tapasin influence maturation efficiency. Collectively, this supports the possibility that tapasin and BF2 proteins have co-evolved, resulting in allele-specific peptide loading in vivo.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A mechanistic basis for the co-evolution of chicken tapasin and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) proteins","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

These peptide‐MHC complexes are displayed at the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we reveal how MHC I molecules achieve this feat in the face of numerous levels of quality control. Among these is the chaperone tapasin, which governs peptide selection in the endoplasmic reticulum as part of the peptide‐loading complex, and we propose key amino acid interactions central to the peptide selection mechanism. We discuss how the aminopeptidase ERAAP fine‐tunes the peptide repertoire available to assembling MHC I molecules, before focusing on the journey of MHC I molecules through the secretory pathway, where calreticulin provides additional regulation of MHC I expression. Lastly we discuss how these processes culminate to influence immune responses.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The cell biology of major histocompatibility complex class I assembly: towards a molecular understanding","type":"publication"}]
