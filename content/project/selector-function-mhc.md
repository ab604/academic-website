This project sought to explain the mechanism of peptide selection by two functionally distinct MHC I allotypes using a combination of molecular dynamics and mathematical modelling of biochemical experiments.

In collaboration with [the Biological Computation Group at Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/biological-computation/) 
we used biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is 
significant for peptide selection, and molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity.

This led to the proposal that MHC I cofactor tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by 
dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and membrane bound domain.
