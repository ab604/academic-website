I am a researcher at the [Centre for Proteomic Research](http://www.proteome.soton.ac.uk/) and [Cancer Sciences Unit](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/research/cancersciences/) at the 
[University of Southampton](https://www.soton.ac.uk). My research interests are 
in antigen processing and presentation by class I MHC molecules, data science 
and proteomics.

My current project aims to understand the involvement of class I MHC molecules
in skin sensitisation to chemical allergens. I also contribute to research into
human cancer and contagious cancer in the
[Tasmanian Devil](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/biosci/research/projects/identifying-peptide-candidates-for-a-vaccine-against-the-contagious-cancer.page), and I am a [Data and Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) instructor.
